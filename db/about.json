		"I created this site to present the most interesting and relevant aspects about me and my work in a more clean way. Besides that, creating this website was also a way to get some pratice with several technologies and concepts I wasn't very familiar with yet, suchs as, SASS, AngularJS, and Responsive Design."

		"summary" : [
			"For this website development were used the usual Web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JS), including some of the most used client-side frameworks at the moment (SASS and AngularJS). For server-side logic were used Node.js with express framework. To populate the website sections I decided to use the LinkedIn API, this way its possible to load profile data directly from LinkedIn without having to duplicate it manually each time something needs to be changed.",
			"The website was tested on the most recent desktop and mobile browsers, such as, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera, and IE11.",
