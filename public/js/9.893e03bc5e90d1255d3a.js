This process could be composed by one or more decision levels. The number of levels was dependent on the client situation and proposal conditions. On each level there were two or three users that could suggest changes and if both agreed they would pass to the next level.\n        * The results of the decision process would determine if the proposal was authorized or not.\n        * Independently of the decision result, the proposal would be sent back to the account manager that created it so he could present it to the client who would then decide to accept or refuse.\n        For each new proposal created, the system would load client information from the Central Database of the Portuguese Bank (BdP). The user pools for each phase of the process would be loaded from the internal bank databases, and if a proposal was approved by the bank it would be stored there.\n        Technologies used: WebSphere (IBM BPM 8.0.1 and IBM ODM 8.0.1), JavaScript (Client and Server side), jQuery, Dojo, Twitter Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, XML, JSON, Java, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n    ",institution:{url:"http://www.banif.pt/",logo:i,name:"Banif"}},{name:"Google Chrome Extension - Web Inspector",url:"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-inspector/enibedkmbpadhfofcgjcphipflcbpelf?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon",video:!1,desc:"\n        Chrome extension that allows users to inspect a web page contents and properties by clicking on certain page elements.
